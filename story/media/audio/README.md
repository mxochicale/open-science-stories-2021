# Recordings of audio with Audacity
* Audio recorded with Audacity 2.3.3 in Ubuntu 20.04X64
* The format of the audio is `*.ogg` or `*.mp3`
* For microphone, I used the build-in mic of my current machine but then I tried the mic of c930 webcam. 
It seems that audio quality can be improved with the use of [Blue Yeti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ4kae92j98) other reference [Blue Yeti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6PfqjI3xio)
