# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale who is a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences at King's College London,
where is researching ultrasound-guidance interventions with the combination of ultrasound imaging with AI and robotics.


## Story (Guest)
_The story should be clear, entertaining and strongly connected to your concept._
His story revolves around his journey of practicing Open Science: 
experiences in closed software licences, his migration to GNU/Linux OS, publication of his open access and reproducible thesis
to then finalise with his current endeavours 
of making science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.


## Explanation (Guest)
_<explanation>_
Start with: “Let’s see what we can learn from this story!” or “Circling back to the concept we are interested in for this episode…” or similar._

Hi everyone. My name Miguel Xochicale and as Heidi pointed out in addition to my research interest in imaging, ai and robotics
I am also passionate about open science and what a best way than sharing a bit of my journey in practicing open science.

_* Using pirate software_  
I guess I wouldn't start from the very moment I was born, right? but that particular time when I start to struggle to use software with limited functionality 
  that led me to find a way to buy pirate CDs in the those sort of black markets in Mexico, you know pirateria.
  But I knew that was not really an ethical move. 
So in that constant search of making things the right way.
  I found GNU/Linux OS which you might hear is open source software allowing users to modify, share and distribute it for free!
  Amazing! isn't it?

_* Migration to GNU/Linux OS_ 
However, free software is sometimes not an easy piece of cake, especially when you don't know anyone using it.
Maybe other challenges in the arena of open souced software are that many open source software projects are under development and 
  they depend on the good heart of contributors. 
But there are various robust projects such as Ubuntu or Mozilla which have been able to create and to integrate good business models 
  to allow their communities and development moving forward

_* no free knowledge_ 
But that is the case with software, how about knowledge? 
  For example, not sure in what percentage but the state-of-the-art of knowledge is not fully available , open accessible, as appears to be under pay-wall.
  So we have the option to use sci-hub. 
  However, similarly to the idea of using pirate software maybe that is not really ethical way to do.
  That brings me to the time of my last year of my bachelor degree, sometime around 2000 -- very long time ago, in a non-private university.
  * So you might think that non-private universities might not have access to the latest discoveries that were in 
  papers under paywall or specialised books which are usually very expensive.
 
_* open and reproducible phd thesis_
I guess the above frustrations lead me to the nice finding of github around 2013 as some sort of great discovery where users not only shared openly code 
but also the knowledge like prepints arxiv and otheres. 
That, I guess that was a big motivation to the idea of not only creating new knowledge for my PhD but also to making the effort 
to put those findings as open accessible and reproducible way.

_* Practicing and making Open Science_
Maybe not an end of this journey of practicing open science, which is, by the way, still in progress but certainly for this story! 
Where I am still with the same thirst for new knowledge and day to day stretching myself to learn and to put in practice perhaps NEW tools (ci/cd, containers, ...) 
  to make science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.

## Concept (Heidi)

In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS through the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessibility of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,
to then finalise on his current endeavours on making a science that aligns to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, re-usability and open accessibility.

## Story (Guest)
Because of closed-software Miguel felt the need to buy pirate copies of licensed software. 
After a while he noticed that there is another option: using free open source software. 
He got really excited about it, but was at the same time struggling to learn the new software. 
The most difficult part was, that nobody he knew used this free software, so he could not ask anybody about it. 
When Miguel wrote his Bachelor thesis, he noticed a similar feeling of needing information about research. 
Again a not completely legal solution – sci-hub – was his only option to access the papers he needed as his University did not have subscriptions. 
Yet again though, he found an alternative legal way of accessing at least some of the research Through GitHub.
In GitHub researchers published their code and sometimes even more than that. 
Now Miguel is a researcher himself. 
He tries to do better than the researchers of the past: he wants to make his work openly available and reusable for others.
