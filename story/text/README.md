# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)
In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS trought the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessiblity of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,

reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, reusability and open accessibility.

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale, and revolves around his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress.
He will take you thought his experience of using pirate software to be able to use closed software licences, 
his migration to GNU/Linux OS as a more ethical path and healthy path for science, 
the little to none accesibilty to knowledge in non-private education sector,
the publication of his open access and reproducible thesis 
to then finalise with his current endeavours 
of making science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.
