# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale who is a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences at King's College London,
where is researching ultrasound-guidance interventions along the areas of medical imaging, AI and robotics.

## Story (Guest)
Hi Everyone. My name Miguel Xochicale, I am a postdoctoral researcher investigating areas 
in medical imaging, AI and robotics 
and also passionate about open science. 
So in the coming minutes I would like to share a bit of my journey in practicing open science 
on how I started, what I have learnt and where I am heading to.

## Explanation (Guest)

[_* Using pirate software_]    
I became genuinely interested in science when I was in my bachelor degree 
but to my surprise I faced the experience of paywalls for papers 
as well as limited software functions due to close licences. 
My thirst for knowledge led me to use pirate software, which felt unethical. 
So, I did not feel that was the right way of doing good science. 
My search for better alternatives led me to discover GNU/Linux operating system (in short Linux). 
and I was so happy to hear that Linux allows users 
to modify, to share and to distribute software for free! 
Amazing! isn't it?


[_* Migration to GNU/Linux OS_]   
However, around the year of 2000 back in Mexico, by the way soy Mexicano, 
I experienced a bit of a steep learning curve of using Linux because I knew few LINUX users. 
But luckily during the two decades that followed, 
I met more LINUX users,
I have sensed more activity in various forums, 
and the LINUX environment has become more friendly. 
Similarly, many projects such as Ubuntu or Mozilla are now good examples of 
functional business models that allow their development moving forward 
and keep their communities growing.


[_* no free knowledge_]   
If that is the case of software, how about knowledge? 
You might have experienced that the state-of-the-art of various areas of knowledge is not fully available 
unless of course you are affiliated to a university that pays for those access fees. 
If that is not your case, then there's actually the alternative to do unethical behaviour and 
get such manuscripts using sci-hub. 
Again, perhaps, that is not the proper way to practice good science. 
Then around 2013 I found GitHub where users shared code openly. 
Additionally, users in GitHub share their knowledge using preprint repositories like ArXiv. 
Preprints, by the way, are manuscripts that can be read freely, but that are usually not yet peer reviewed.


[_* Practicing and making Open Science_]   
So, the free software in Linux, 
the great spirit of GitHub users to share code, 
and the open access repository for pre-prints 
are a big motivation for me to not only create new knowledge 
but to make the effort of putting those findings open, accessible and reproducible for everyone!
Doing good and open science still has many challenges, 
but I am certain that my little contributions 
(such as 
 the publication of a fully open accessible PhD thesis or 
 the development of frameworks for open scientific communication)
might provide to the next generation of scientists 
a more legitimate scientific environment 
where science can be more reproducible, inclusive, transparent and openly accessible.
