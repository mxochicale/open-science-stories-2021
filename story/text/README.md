# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)
In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS trought the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessiblity of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,
to then finallise on his current endevours on making a science that aligns to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, reusability and open accessibility.

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale, and revolves around his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress.
He will take you trought his experience of using pirate software to be able to use closed software licences, 
his migration to GNU/Linux OS as a more ethical path and healthy path for science, 
the little to none accesibilty to knowledge in non-private education sector,
the publication of his open access and reproducbile thesis 
to then finalise with his current endevours 
of making science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.

## Story (Guest)
_The story should be clear, entertaining and strongly connected to your concept._
Hi everyone. My name Miguel Xochicale and as Heidi was pointed out I would like to share a bit of this journey of praciting open science.

## Explanation (Guest)
_<explanation>
Start with: “Let’s see what we can learn from this story!” or “Circling back to the concept we are interested in for this episode…” or similar._

[* Using pirate software]
I guess I wouldn't start from the very moment I bornt, right?  but that particular time when I start to struggle to use software 
that has limited functionality and how I managed to buy pirate CDs in the those sort of black markeds in Mexico, you know pirateria, 
but I knew that was not a really an ethical move to not say smart move.
So in that constant search of making thing the right way, I found GNU/Linux OS which you might heard and 
it short is open source software that allows you to modify share and distribute for free! Amazing!

[* Migration to GNU/Linux OS]
However, free software is sometimes not an easy piece of cake as many of the projects are under development and they depends on the good heart of contributors. There is also robust projects such as Ubuntu or Mozilla that has been able to create integreate good bussinnes models to allows their continous development. 

[*  no free knowledge]
But that is the case of software, how about knowledge? Papers under pay-wall, the use of sci-hub, open books? the secret sauce reicpy of my favorite tacos! 
that brings me to the time of my  bachelor degree, very long time ago, sometime around 2000, in a non-private university
where you can tell the difficul of accesssing  the lastest discoveries that were in papers under paywall or 
specialliced books which are usually vvery expensive.
 
[* open and reproducible phd thesis]
I guess the above fustrrations lead me to the nice finding of github around 2013 
that made me crazy as such network not only shared openly code but also the knowledge 
That, I guess that was a big motivation to the idea of not only creating a bit of new knowledge for my PhD 
but also to making such findings open accessible and reprodudible. 

[* praciting and making Open Science]
Maybe not an end of this journey of practing open science, which is, by the way, still in progress 
but for certainly for this story!
Where I am still with the same thirst for new knowledge and streching myself to learn and put in 
practice perhaps NEW tools (ci/cd, containers, ...) 
to make science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.
