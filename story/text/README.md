# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)
In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS trought the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessiblity of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,
to then finallise on his current endevours on making a science that aligns to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, reusability and open accessibility.

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale, and revolves around his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress.
He will take you trought his experience of using pirate software to be able to use closed software licences, 
his migration to GNU/Linux OS as a more ethical path and healthy path for science, 
the little to none accesibilty to knowledge in non-private education sector,
the publication of his open access and reproducbile thesis 
to then finalise with his current endevours 
of making science that is reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.

## Story (Guest)
_The story should be clear, entertaining and strongly connected to your concept._
Hi everyone. My name Miguel Xochicale and as Heidi was pointed out I would like to share a bit of this journey of praciting open science.

## Explanation (Guest)
_<explanation>
Start with: “Let’s see what we can learn from this story!” or “Circling back to the concept we are interested in for this episode…” or similar._


[* Using pirate software]
I guess I wouldn't start from the very moment I bornt, right but that moment when I start to struggle to use software 
that has limited functionality and how I managed to buy pirate CDs in the markeds in Mexico but I knew in that was not really an ethical move.
To which in such constant search of making thing the right way, I found GNU/Linux OS.

[* Migration to GNU/Linux OS]
...


[*  no free knowledge]  
Also, when I was my bachelor degree, very long time ago, around 2000, in a non-private university 
I remember that was difficul to access the lastes discoveries as many were under paywall.
 
[* open and reproducible phd thesis]
This started when I discovered github around 2013 and marvelled to all the open source code which 
was really aligend to that idea of not only creating a bit of new knowledge but also to 
making it open accessible and reprodudible. 


[* praciting and making Open Science]
That leads to the end of this story but to say that is a journey that is still in progres.
I guess if you are thirsty of knowledge this is a never ending story as I am playing with new
tools of continous integrations, containers and trying and all in all trying to
