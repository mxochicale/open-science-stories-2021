# Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)

## Intro (Heidi)
Welcome to “Open Science Stories”, where we explain Open Science concepts using stories. My name is Heidi Seibold.

## Concept (Heidi)
Today’s story comes from Miguel Xochicale who is a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences at King's College London,
where is researching ultrasound-guidance interventions along the areas of medical imaging, AI and robotics.

## Story (Guest)
Miguel's story revolves around his journey of practicing Open Science that goes from:
early experiences on limited exposure to open access knowledge,
his migration from Windows to GNU/Linux OS, 
and current challenges of practicing open science.

## Explanation (Guest)
Hi Everyone. My name Miguel Xochicale, I am a postdoctoral researcher investigating areas in medical imaging, AI and robotics
and also passionate about open science. 
So in the coming minutes I would like to share a bit of my journey in practicing open science
on how I started, what I have learnt and where I am heading to. 

[_* Using pirate software_]    
I became genuinely interested in science when I was in my bachelor degree but to my surprise I faced 
the experience of paywalls for papers as well as limited software functions due to close licence. 
So, my thirst to knowledge led me to do unethical behaviour to then consume pirate software.
However, I did not feel that was the right direction of doing good science to which 
such constant search led me to discover GNU/Linux operating system (OS), in short LINUX
I was so happy to heard that GNU/Linux allows users to modify, to share and to distribute software for free! 
Amazing! isn't it?

[_* Migration to GNU/Linux OS_]   
However, back in Mexico around the year of 2000, I experienced a bit of a steep learning curve of using GNU/Linux OS 
because I knew few LINUX users, to then found the few supported hardware for my computers.
But luckily thorough the previous two decades, I have meet more LINUX users, 
I have sensed more activity in various forums, and the LINUX environment has been become more friendly. 
Similarly, many projects such as Ubuntu or Mozilla are now good examples of functional business models 
that allow their development moving forward and keep growing their communities.

[_* no free knowledge_]   
But that is the case of software, how about knowledge?
You might have experienced that the state-of-the-art of various areas of knowledge is not fully available unless 
of course you are affiliated to a university that pays for those accessibly fees.
If that is not your case, then there's actually the alternative to do unethical behaviour and 
get such manuscript using sci-hub.
Again that, perhaps, that is not the proper way to practice good science to which around 2013 I found GitHub
as great discovery where users not only shared openly code but also their knowledge via pre-prints using ArXiv. 

[_* Practicing and making Open Science_]   
So, the free software in GNU/Linux, 
the great spirit of GitHub user to share code,
and the open access repository for pre-prints
are big motivations for me to not only create new knowledge but to make the effort 
of putting those findings open accessible and reproducible for everyone.
Doing good open access science still has many challenges, 
but I am certain that my little contributions
(such as fully open accessible PhD thesis, frameworks for open scientific communications, to mention a few)
might provide to the next generation of scientists 
a more legitimate scientific environment 
where science can be more reproducible, inclusive, transparent, reusable and open accessible.

# BLURS


to get access to the latest advances of various areas of knowledge. 

## Concept (Heidi)
In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS through the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessibility of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,
to then finalise on his current endeavours on making a science that aligns to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, re-usability and open accessibility.


## Explanation (Guest)
_<explanation>_
Start with: “Let’s see what we can learn from this story!” or “Circling back to the concept we are interested in for this episode…” or similar._


## Story (Guest)
[_The story should be clear, entertaining and strongly connected to your concept._]
Because of closed-software Miguel felt the need to buy pirate copies of licensed software. 
After a while he noticed that there is another option: using free open source software. 
He got really excited about it, but was at the same time struggling to learn the new software. 
The most difficult part was, that nobody he knew used this free software, so he could not ask anybody about it. 
When Miguel wrote his Bachelor thesis, he noticed a similar feeling of needing information about research. 
Again a not completely legal solution – sci-hub – was his only option to access the papers he needed as his University did not have subscriptions. 
Yet again though, he found an alternative legal way of accessing at least some of the research Through GitHub.
In GitHub researchers published their code and sometimes even more than that. 
Now Miguel is a researcher himself. 
He tries to do better than the researchers of the past: he wants to make his work openly available and reusable for others.

[_* open and reproducible phd thesis_]
That, I guess that was a big motivation to the idea 

[_* Practicing and making Open Science_]
Maybe not an end of this journey of practicing open science, which is, by the way, still in progress but certainly for this story! 
Where I am still with the same thirst for new knowledge and day to day stretching myself to learn and to put in practice perhaps NEW tools (ci/cd, containers, ...)


# FEEDBACK

## Fri 30 April 10am
In the catch-up with Lea, she mentions that the story is still not clear. 
Perhaps finding a way to connect each section and add some sort of conclusion will help to close the podcast.
