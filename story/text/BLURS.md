## Practicing Open Science (a journey that is still in progress)

as well contributions of many others such as this amazing podcast 
to get access to the latest advances of various areas of knowledge. 

## Concept (Heidi)
In this episode, Miguel Xochicale, will take you into his journey of practicing Open Science: a journey that is still in progress. 
You will hear about how he got interested in GNU/Linux OS through the limitation of closed software, 
the little to none accessibility of open access knowledge from his non-private education,
the publication of his open access and reproducible PhD thesis,
to then finalise on his current endeavours on making a science that aligns to the principles of 
reproducibility, inclusiveness, transparency, re-usability and open accessibility.


## Explanation (Guest)

Start with: “Let’s see what we can learn from this story!” or “Circling back to the concept we are interested in for this episode…” or similar._


## Story (Guest)
[_The story should be clear, entertaining and strongly connected to your concept._]
Because of closed-software Miguel felt the need to buy pirate copies of licensed software. 
After a while he noticed that there is another option: using free open source software. 
He got really excited about it, but was at the same time struggling to learn the new software. 
The most difficult part was, that nobody he knew used this free software, so he could not ask anybody about it. 
When Miguel wrote his Bachelor thesis, he noticed a similar feeling of needing information about research. 
Again a not completely legal solution – sci-hub – was his only option to access the papers he needed as his University did not have subscriptions. 
Yet again though, he found an alternative legal way of accessing at least some of the research Through GitHub.
In GitHub researchers published their code and sometimes even more than that. 
Now Miguel is a researcher himself. 
He tries to do better than the researchers of the past: he wants to make his work openly available and reusable for others.

[_* open and reproducible phd thesis_]
That, I guess that was a big motivation to the idea 

[_* Practicing and making Open Science_]
Maybe not an end of this journey of practicing open science, which is, by the way, still in progress but certainly for this story! 
Where I am still with the same thirst for new knowledge and day to day stretching myself to learn and to put in practice perhaps NEW tools (ci/cd, containers, ...)


# FEEDBACK

## Fri 30 April 10am
In the catch-up with Lea, she mentions that the story is still not clear. 
Perhaps finding a way to connect each section and add some sort of conclusion will help to close the podcast.
